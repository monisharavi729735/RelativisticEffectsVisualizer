# Relativistic Effects Visualizer üöÄ

**Relativistic Effects Visualizer** is a web application that offers an interactive and visual representation of relativistic effects, such as **Length Contraction** and **Time Dilation**, as described in **Special Relativity**. Built using **React.js**, **Tailwind CSS** and **Chart.js**, this project helps users better understand the behavior of space and time at relativistic speeds through dynamic visualizations.

## üåü Features

### 1. **Interactive Control Panel**
- Adjust the velocity ratio \(v/c\) using a slider or numeric input.
- Watch real-time changes in **Length Contraction** and **Time Dilation** as the velocity ratio changes.

### 2. **Length Contraction**
- A dynamically contracting rocket illustration is displayed based on the chosen velocity ratio.
- Displays the current **Length Contraction Factor** in real-time.

### 3. **Time Dilation**
- A simulated clock expands and contracts to demonstrate **Time Dilation**.
- Shows the dilated time corresponding to the chosen velocity ratio.

### 4. **Graph of Relativistic Effects**
- A line chart plots the relationship between velocity and the relativistic effects:
  - **Length Contraction (Factor)**
  - **Time Dilation (Seconds)**

### 5. **Concept Explanation Page**
- Detailed educational content explaining key concepts in **Special Relativity**:
  - Principle of Relativity
  - The constancy of the speed of light
  - Time and space transformations at relativistic speeds.

### 6. **Feedback Form**
- A feedback form is included to gather user input and suggestions for improvement.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### **Relativistic Equations**

1. **Length Contraction Factor:**
   $L = L_0 \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}$
   Where \(L_0\) is the original length, and \(L\) is the contracted length.

2. **Time Dilation:**
   $\Delta t' = \frac{\Delta t}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$
   Where delta t is the proper time, and delta t' is the dilated time.

### **Visualization**
- **Rocket Image Scaling**: The width of the rocket dynamically adjusts based on the calculated length contraction factor.
- **Clock Simulation**: Time dilation is represented visually through an expanding ring animation, with the dilated time displayed on a clock.

### **Graph Representation**
- A line chart dynamically plots the variations in **Length Contraction Factor** and **Time Dilation** as the velocity ratio \(v/c\) changes from 0 to 0.99.
